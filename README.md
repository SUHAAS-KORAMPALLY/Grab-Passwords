# Steal Wi-Fi Passwords
Steal saved Wi-Fi passwords of Windows OS in one click.

# What does this do?
Creates a file (passwords.txt) in the directory from which clickme.exe is runned.  
passwords.txt contains all the saved Wi-Fi passwords.

# Usage 
I recommend copying clickme.exe into a pendrive and run it.  
This will create passwords.txt in the pendrive.  
Once this is done you can take out the pendrive and run away :P
